##QAQC overview

The components of our quality review are:

* Accuracy
    + A matrix spike is used to document the bias of a method in a given sample matrix.   
    + designated 'spike' samples are spiked with a known concentration. The difference between the concentration before and after divided by the spiked amount is the percent recovery. Spike samples are acceptable if the percent recovery is 100% +/- the accuracy criteria established by the standard methods manual and listed in tables 3 and 4.  Otherwise, the spike and it's associated samples are flagged as rejected.
    + NOTE: the QAPP only requires that we analyze spikes for nutrients, metals and minerals (see section II.5.A.b)! Iâ€™m presuming this excludes solids, turbidity, conductivity, and hardness in addition to in situ parameters, alkalinity, DOC, and chlorophyll a
    + NOTE: we only examine the matrix spike samples. The matrix spike duplicate samples would only be analyzed when we are meausring organics. That's not the case in any BWAM programs.  
* Precision   
    + Duplicate samples are analyzed from the same date/location to assess the method's precision.    
    + Previously, the % difference between these samples must satisfy the precision criteria set forth in table 3 (screening) and table 4 (routine). In this document, we propose using a new method developed by Ohio EPA that offers a curved threshold.    
* Equipment Blank exceedances  (result > reporting limit)  
    + Step 1: identify a reporting limit based on the data collected in 2017+18
    + Step 2: pull EB values that exceed these reporting limits
    + Step 3: flag sample values that are less than 10x (flagged calculated), 5x (flagged trend), and 3x (rejected)  
* Completeness: Did we collect all the samples we intended to 
* Holding time exceedances  
* Temperature upon receipt exceedances  

##Associating Samples  

Plotting the wallkill sample dates to understand how best to associate them.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
samples<-unique(wallkill[c('sample_date','lab_sdg')])
samples$freq<-1
samples$type<-"standard samples"
samples$sample_date<-as.Date(samples$sample_date,"%m/%d/%Y")
blanksamples<-unique(EB[c('sample_date','lab_sdg')])
blanksamples$freq<-2
blanksamples$type<-"equipment blanks"
blanksamples$sample_date<-as.Date(blanksamples$sample_date,"%m/%d/%Y")
dupsamples<-unique(dup[c('sample_date.parent','lab_sdg')])
dupsamples$freq<-3
dupsamples$type<-"duplicates"
names(dupsamples)[names(dupsamples)=="sample_date.parent"]<-"sample_date"
dupsamples$sample_date<-as.Date(dupsamples$sample_date,"%m/%d/%Y")
spikesamples<-unique(spike[c('sample_date','lab_sdg')])
spikesamples$freq<-4
spikesamples$type<-"spike samples"
spikesamples$sample_date<-as.Date(spikesamples$sample_date,"%m/%d/%Y")
#merge together
samples<-merge(samples,blanksamples,all=TRUE)
samples<-merge(samples,dupsamples,all=TRUE)
samples<-merge(samples,spikesamples,all=TRUE)

library(ggplot2)
print(ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=samples,aes(sample_date,freq,color=type)) +
  ylab("sample types")+
  xlab("sample date"))
rm(list=c('samples','blanksamples','dupsamples','spikesamples'))
```

## Info from EDD reports
Conclusions drawn from reading lab reports  
I have to read these when I get back. Here are all the SDGs associated with these data:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
unique(wallkill$lab_sdg)
```

```{r, child = 'sections/Accuracy.Rmd'}

```

```{r, child = 'sections/Precision.Rmd'}

```

```{r, child = 'sections/Equipment.Blanks.Rmd'}

```




```{r}
#, }
#child = 'sections/Parameter.pairs.Rmd'}

```
