R1806429,Metals: Method 200.7; R1806429-001: The Relative Percent Difference (RPD) for the serial dilution test of one or more analytes was above the method control limits which indicates the presence of physical or chemical interference for analysis of these analytes in this sample matrix. Exceedances have been flagged. Method 200.8; 07/19/2018: One Continuing Calibration Verification (CCV) exceeded control limits for Copper. Reported samples were not affected by failed CCV therefore no further corrective action was taken.
R1806429,General Chemistry: Method 180.1: One or more samples were received with insufficient hold time remaining to complete the analysis within the recommended limit. The analysis was performed as soon as possible after receipt by the laboratory. The data is flagged to indicate the holding time violation. Method 353.2: One or more samples were received with insufficient hold time remaining to complete the analysis within the recommended limit. The analysis was performed as soon as possible after receipt by the laboratory. The data is flagged to indicate the holding time violation.
