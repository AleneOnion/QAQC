lab_sdg R1806960,"Method 180.1 (turbidity), R1806960-002,003: The analysis was performed slightly outisde the 48 hour holding time due to a laboratory error"
lab_sdg R1806960,"Method 200.7 (analyzes Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Potassium, and Sodium) R1806960-001, 002: The Relative Percent Difference (RPD) for the serial dilution test of one or more analytes was above the method control limits which indicates the presence of physical or chemical interference for analysis of these analytes in this sample matrix. Exceedances have been flagged."
lab_sdg R1806960,"Method 353.2 (analyzes Nitrite and Nitrite + Nitrate),R1806960-004:The analysis was initially performed within the recommended holding time but due to a spiking error the sample could not be reported. The reanalysis was performed past the recommended holding time."
lab_sdg R1806961,"Method 180.1 (turbidity), R1806961-001,002: The analysis was analyzed slightly outisde the 48 hour holding time of the method due to a laboratory error."
lab_sdg R1806961,"Method 353.2 (analyzes Nitrite and Nitrite + Nitrate),R1806961-012:The analysis was initially performed within the recommended holding time. Reanalysis at a dilution was required. The reanalysis was performed past the recommended holding time"
lab_sdg R1807763,Method 180.1 (turbidity): One or more samples were received with sufficient hold time remaining to complete the analysis within the recommended limit. Due to Lab error the analysis was performed as soon as possible after receipt by the laboratory. The data is flagged to indicate the holding time violation.
lab_sdg R1808566,"Method 200.7 (analyzes Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Potassium, and Sodium), R1808566-014: The Relative Percent Difference (RPD) for the serial dilution test of one or more analytes was above the method control limits which indicates the presence of physical or chemical interference for analysis of these analytes in this sample matrix. Exceedances have been flagged."
lab_sdg R1808568,Method 180.1 (turbidity): Due to analyst error one sample was analyzed out of hold time. The data is flagged to indicate the holding time violation.
